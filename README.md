# Pokemon-App
Most of us have been huge fans of Pokemon since childhood. You can make a very simple and fun React project using PokeAPI. Here you can fetch the Pokemon details or their characteristics through this API and you can make a fun project using this. Make different cards for each Pokemon and in each card show their pictures, their names, etc. You can make a “read more” button on a Pokemon card, on clicking those buttons users will get to know more things about each pokemon. To generate more and more Pokemons, create a button too much that on clicking that button, users will get to see more Pokemon cards.
